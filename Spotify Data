# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# With this, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data using the following SQL. 

--First I determined how many rows of data there were in the table.
SELECT COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

--Here I learned which 5 songs were the most popular
SELECT artist_name, popularity, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Popularity DESC
LIMIT 5

--With this query, I discovered which song had and energy greater than .7 and a loudness greater than -3
SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy > 0.7
AND loudness > -3
ORDER BY energy DESC
