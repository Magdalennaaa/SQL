#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product


--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product, location, quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%548 Lincoln%'

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
COUNT (distinct acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

-1. Which location in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING)
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2

--2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product

--3.What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT AVG(quantity*price) AS Average_Spending
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--4.What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS Average_Items
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--5.Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 1
